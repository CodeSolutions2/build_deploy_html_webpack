      - name: Step 3 - Install the React compiler - it converts the files in to browser readable files
        run: |
          npm install react@latest react-dom@latest;

      - name: Step 4 - Print/Compile (index.js via index.html) using Node.js. Read the main.js file via index.html, push the output html to repository
      # Node.js can be used in many ways- 0. it is a JavaScript derived language that has a library packing system, 1. it is a type of browser/networking environment without a graphical interface, that sends/receives data to a port. Any Node.js file reader can read an html file that references a javaScript file, written in Node.js and then display the correct HTML file. The type of file that one inputs into a Node.js file reader, one receives the same output file type. Thus, if an HTML file is inputted into a file reader the corresponding output will be an HTML file. 
      # Idea 0: just read the index.html file using the file reader and save the output html to the repository.
